# üß§glove
Code and images of the **wireless bluetooth glove** used as the input device for the experimental system (see all repositories with `expS` prefix).

### Main characteristics:
> 1. Arduino based.
> 2. Bluetooth communication.
> 3. Two hands.
> 4. 2 joysticks and 8 buttons in total 
> 5. Full hand mobility.
> 6. Powered by two 3.7v lithium ion rechargeable batteries

# üíªRequirements
## Hardware
- Two Arduino nano
- Joysticks + Buttons
- Electrical wire
- Swimsuit fabric
- Two 3.7v lithium ion rechargeable battery
- Soldering/Sewing material
  
# üñ±Ô∏è Use
These are used as the performer's main input device. They control the [expS_menu](https://github.com/alumiaCoder/expS_menu).

These gloves are wireless, so the user can move freely. There is one bluetooth device that handles the communication of both hands:

# ‚òÆÔ∏èKeep in mind
- I am sharing this here because some concepts might interest some people. **The code is not made to run first time**. All the system needs to be setup,
with all the credentials and the right hardware.
